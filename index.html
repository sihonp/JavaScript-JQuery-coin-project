      <h2>World Wide Coins By Sihon,</h2><br>
      <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.[1][2] Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. </p>

      <p>Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).[3] When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.</p>
